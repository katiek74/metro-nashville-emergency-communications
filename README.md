# Metro Nashville Emergency Communications

This was the first of two all-class projects for the Full Time Data Analytics Cohort 2 class at Nashville Software School. The class broke into teams with each team exploring a different topic for analysis and then came together to create a united presentation to provide insights to our client, Metro Nashville Emergency Communications Center.

# The Data:
During the tornado on March 3rd, 2020 and the derecho on May 3rd, 2020, Nashville Emergency Communications received a number of 911 calls and dispatches were issued to address them. We have been given data for the calls and dispatches around these times and will analyze the data to gain insights.

# Contributions:
My team was tasked with exploring the "second wave" of calls that occurred with both events. After the initial expected spike in calls, there was a second spike some time later. We looked at when this second wave occurred, what types of calls they were, and tried to find a reason for the delay. We were unsuccessful in finding a clear reason for why these calls came in later, but were able to determine a time frame of when to expect these calls so the emergency call center can be more prepared with staffing needs in the future.
